## Get Started
Program is run through the main class, and no other classes contain main. 

## Testing
XML configuration files used to load simulations are stored in the data package. 

## Resource Files
Resource files for GUI Text and CSS are included in the resource package. XML configuration files are stored in the data package.

## Using the Program
* After the program starts, press load and pick an XML file to load a simulation. Load can also be pressed at any time to change
simulation.
* Cell configuration in XML can be one of three types: specific locations, number of cells by type and probability by type
* Press play to start the simulation, pause to pause, and move the slider to change the animation speed.
* Pressing step will pause the simulation if it is running, and step through the simulation one cycle per click.
* Either while playing or while paused, press step to update the simulation one frame per click.
* Press options for a screen to popup to change various parameters for the current simulation.
* Press save to save the current simulation configuration to an XML file.
* Press +/- to zoom in/out of the simulation.
* Click on a cell to change its state
* If grid is larger than the display region, scroll to navigate the whole grid.
* Cell shape, grid type, and neighbor pattern can all be changed dynamically with the choice boxes at the bottom right.

## Features
Allow user to dynamically change cell shape, grid type and neighbor pattern during the simulation
